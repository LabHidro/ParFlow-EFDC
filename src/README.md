# ParFlow

![ParFlow CI Test](https://github.com/parflow/parflow/workflows/ParFlow%20CI%20Test/badge.svg)

ParFlow is an open-source, modular, parallel watershed flow model. It
includes fully-integrated overland flow, the ability to simulate
complex topography, geology and heterogeneity and coupled land-surface
processes including the land-energy budget, biogeochemistry and snow
(via CLM). It is multi-platform and runs with a common I/O structure
from laptop to supercomputer. ParFlow is the result of a long,
multi-institutional development history and is now a collaborative
effort between CSM, LLNL, UniBonn and UCB. ParFlow has been coupled to
the mesoscale, meteorological code ARPS and the NCAR code WRF.

For an overview of the major features and capabilities see the
following paper: [Simulating coupled surfaceâ€“subsurface flows with
ParFlow v3.5.0: capabilities, applications, and ongoing development of
an open-source, massively parallel, integrated hydrologic
model](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/13/1373/2020/gmd-13-1373-2020.pdf).

The Parflow User Manual is available at [Parflow Users
Manual](https://github.com/parflow/parflow/blob/master/parflow-manual.pdf).
The manual contains additional documentation on how to use ParFlow and
setup input files.  A quick start is included below.

### Citing Parflow

If you want the DOI for a specific release see:
